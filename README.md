## Introduction

### I am a "software engineer"

Ohhh, big fancy word right?
What does it mean?

- Well, let's break it down.
- What's an engineer?
- Someone that makes car or plane engines?
- Maybe! Sure!

An engineer is someone that builds things!
A software engineer builds software!
- Wait, what is software?
- Computer programs!
- Computer programs are EVERYWHERE!
- In your SmartBoards
- ... In your or your parent's phones!
- ... In airplanes!
- ... On the international space station orbiting the Earth right now!
- ... Even when you watch a video on YouTube! YouTube is program that does something on a computer.
It lets you watch videos.

### Why is it "SOFT"ware?
- Well, real computers are things you can touch right? They are hard.
- Software, a computer program, lives INSIDE the computer.
- You can't really touch it.
- So the name was given as the opposite of HARDWARE.
- OK, my job is to boss computers around!
- I tell them what I (or, my boss) wants them to do.
- That sounds really boring! But it's actually amazing!
- Some of you look like you're not so sure.
- I get to figure out fun puzzles all day long every day.
- It's a lot of fun!
- How many of you have gotten a little excited when you finally solve a tough math problem?
- You know that feeling? I have that all day, well most days!
- I'm going to show you a few examples of some games, how they work, and even a
  bit of surprise at the end.

## What I do

There are a bunch of words that all mean the same thing for what I do:

- PROGRAMMER
- SOFTWARE ENGINEER
- DEVELOPER
- CODER

So, what kinds of programs do I develop?

I have been a programmer for a long time, over 25 years!
I have been lucky to get PAID to make:

- websites
- iphone and ipad apps
- games

... and I've made a bunch of programs that HELP PEOPLE do what they want.

- I wrote a program that can check to see how well you can hear things.
  Your school nurse could use it to check if you have any hearing problems.

- I helped students in college do everything they need to become counselors.

- In my current job, I'm helping doctors get information to patients after
  they have a surgery so that they feel better faster.

## What is it like?

- Do I do math all day? sometimes!
- science? sometimes!
- really hard technical stuff? a little!

It's really all about communication!
- as a software engineer, I have to talk with people that hire me to make programs so I know what it is that they want me to make (and let me tell you they almost never know what they really want!).
- as a programmer or coder, I have to talk to the computer and tell it what I want it to do!

Computers are not "smart". Computers are just really fast at doing what they are told! We have to hold the computer's hand and guide it.

- We speak English and other languages to each other, and at home.
  But to talk to a computer, you have to speak their language.
  Why don't we use English to program a computer?
  It's too vague and confusing and looooooonggg. What did you mean?
  Computers need to be spoken to very very precisely, very accurately!

I will show you two games that I've programmed to give you a feel of what it's
like to be a programmer a bit!

## Tic Tac Toe

- Everyone's played tic-tac-toe here I imagine!
- How does it work? Right, Xs and Os.
- How does a player win?
- Three Xs or Os in any row (across), column (up and down), or diagonally (top left to bottom right or
  top right to bottom left). Right? OK
- OK, so what did we just do?
  We all agreed on what it is we want our TTT program to be about
  and very precisely how one player wins or loses (or ties!).
- Now that we know what we want the computer to do, we just have to tell it how to do it for us!
- But first, let's play the game!

> SHOW THE GAME

- OK so what are some of the things we might need to tell the computer in order to play this game?
- Clicking on a square to put an X or O there
- Switching between X and O after each turn
- Checking for game over.
- Ahhh, how do we know when the game has ended? Who won, right?
- Who can come up with steps or checks to see who won?
    - Rows
    - Columns
    - Diagonals
    - All the same
- OK, so we see that coding a game as simple as TTT has a lot of steps right? But, none of
  those steps was hard!  We just have think hard about each step.

> If interest, show the code for the check of the game over condition

## HIGH-LOW

- OK, great. Let's move on to our second game!
- Who has heard of HIGH-LOW?
- What is it?
- A number guessing game, that's right!
- Pick a number between 1 and 1000.

> Let them guess numbers

- OK, but let's JUICE it up a little bit.

> Add the version that has the confetti on win!

## AUTOGUESSER

Now, watch this! One of YOU pick a number between 1 and 1000.
The computer will now guess your number WITHIN 10 GUESSES!

What? How is that possible? There are a THOUSAND different numbers!

How can the computer guess it in 10 or fewer guesses?
First, let's see if it can!

> Have a kid write down a number between 1 and 1000
> Go through the HIGH, LOW loop
> Show how it works.

- Why am I showing you this?
- Because it's an example of solving problems!
- It's like a little puzzle.
- These types of problems come up all the time in my job.
- OK, so what is the trick? Does anybody see it?

> Show rectangle on the board
> Cut the rectangle in half each time

- You see, we get rid of HALF of the numbers after each guess!

- So what does the code for this look like? It's super easy!

> show test.py

## MINECRAFT

I'm sure most of you have heard of or play games like Minecraft, Roblox, and so on, yeah?

Are those just regular programs too?

Yes! It's not magic! There's just lots of people like me working together on
MINECRAFT and ROBLOX to make it something kids can play!

MINECRAFT even started out as ONE PROGRAMMER working for months and months on
it!  Now I think it's more like 40-50 people!


## CHAT GPT

> If there's time, show ChatGPT.
> Have a backup video of a session in case it is down!

So, now let's give an example of a program that DOES NOT need super careful
instructions to do what it does.

Wait, what? Didn't I just say you have to be super specific when talking to
computers? You do!

BUT, this next style of program is very new and is very different. A lot of the
work in programming and "Computer Science" is really new! It's constantly
changing and evolving! It's super interesting to see what is possible week to
week!

But, let's show you what some fancy programmers have come up with!
Who's heard of Chat GPT here? Anyone?
So, what is it?

This is an example where we're starting to see computer programs that
do NOT need to be told EXACTLY what to do and they can KIND OF figure it
out!


Another example of this is Google's chess program ALPHA ZERO. It had
NO INSTRUCTIONS on how chess works. None! And still became the best
chess player ever in a matter of hours of practice!

HOLD ON A SECOND!

Does this mean that I'm out of a job? That computers will program themselves?
No! It's super important that computers are NOT SMART even though they can do
some pretty incredible things!

So how does something like ChatGPT work? Well, the people who made it wrote a
program that looks for patterns in sentences of English! When you ask ChatGPT a
question, it looks for words that SEEM like

But it's important to note that ChatGPT doesn't UNDERSTAND anything. It just
knows how to write in English since it was TRAINED to do it that way! Just not
super specifically!

A programmer's job might change to WORK WITH these advanced programs but truly
SMART computers are a very long ways away.

Don't worry, it's not like the movies! We won't build robots that turn on us
anytime soon!


## TAKEAWAYS

* Computers are NOT smart!
* Anyone can program a computer!
* Programming is all about telling a computer what you want it to do!
* Figuring that out is challenging but a lot of fun!

Any questions?
